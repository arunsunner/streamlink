#### This fork of streamlink combines the most recent version of [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) with the work done by [sunghome](https://github.com/sunghome/streamlink_optionalkey/) to add support for passing decrpytion keys to the ffmpeg backend when playing back DRM protected streams.

##### YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE `ffmpeg` and `mp4decrypt` in your PATH for these changes to work effectively. Please ensure these are both installed on your system before proceeding.

If you've already installed streamlink, you can use a text editor to patch the differences into your own copy, however this isn't recommended as these changes will be overwritten when updating using your package manager.
